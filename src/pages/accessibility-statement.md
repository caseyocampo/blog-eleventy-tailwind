This statement applies to caseyocampo.com and does not cover any of the links shared on blog posts or links mentioned on pages.

The way I have built this website means that you should be able to:

- change colors, contrast levels, and fonts
- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate the website using just a keyboard
- navigate the website using speech recognition software
- listen to the website using a screen reader

That said, I am not perfect and it is possible that I’ve missed some opportunities for accessibility enhancements. As I continue to educate myself on accessibility guidelines and best practices, I commit to updating this site to make it as accessible as possible to the best of my knowledge and ability.

## Contact me about an accessibility issue

It is my priority to make this website as accessible as possible. If you notice an accessibility or usability issue with this website, you can reach me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseyocampo/" target="_blank"

            >. I’m interested in fixing any problems and improving my website so that it works for everybody.

## Compliance

To the best of my knowledge, this website is fully compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 to a Level AA standard.
