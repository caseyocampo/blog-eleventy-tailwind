I work as a full-time Accessibility Engineer and I love it. I also enjoy learning more about [accessibility and web development](/certifications/), creating projects, and writing about things I’ve learned online. Mostly here on this site.

When I’m not working my day job or coding side projects, I like to keep my brain and body active.

My hobbies include reading, doing yoga, running, and learning guitar. I also enjoy adventuring to random parks and places with my partner. We’ve traveled to most cities along Florida’s east coast and have gone out of state to Nevada and Texas.

## My background

In 2016, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Central Florida. Like many others, I realized I didn’t want to pursue a career related to my degree. (I majored in Exercise Science.)

After graduation, I took some time to figure out what direction I wanted to go in career-wise.

During this discovery period, I held a part-time job and launched a modest online business on WordPress.

It was a lifestyle apparel company that built up a decent following despite my not knowing anything about running a clothing business.

Anyway, I bought a WordPress theme that worked well for selling physical products online. It looked great but there were some styling tweaks I wanted to make.

Nothing major, mostly little things like color and spacing changes.

After submitting a few design requests to WordPress theme developers, I started to become familiar with HTML and CSS.

My support tickets looked a little like this:

> <i>“Hey, can we change this button to this color?”<span class="mb-4 block"></span>
> “Hi there, I noticed the spacing in this area looks a little squished. Can we add some space between this text and this image?”</i>

Eventually, I started to pick up the lingo.

I figured out that “spacing” could either mean “padding” or “margin”.And “this color” was actually a pound sign followed by some crazy string of six digits; this madness is what developers call a hex color code.

Conversations like this are what sparked my interest in coding for a living.

I just kept finding myself asking “why” and then learning about it, and then asking “why” again.

It was curious fun.

## One year after graduation

In early 2017, I committed to learning how to code for a living.

From what I researched, a career in tech was exactly what I wanted:

- the opportunity to continue learning
- creative problem-solving
- a high earning potential
- the possibility of working remotely
- the opportunity to contribute to something bigger than myself

I studied day and night doing my best to learn the foundations of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my own.

(By the way, it really was day and night. I had a part-time job with a varying schedule that allowed me to learn at the most random hours.)

I used freeCodeCamp.com as my main curriculum and YouTube to delve more into certain topics. Of course, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the important role coffee played in all of this.

I spent months (less than six) learning and building projects before I landed my first developer job. It was a full-time in-office position where my primary responsibilities were coding emails and blog posts.

Since then, I’ve gone on to freelance and work full-time jobs at development agencies and small to medium-sized businesses as a Front End Developer.

## Where I’m at now

Presently, I work full-time and 100% remotely as an Accessibility Engineer where I audit web pages and designs for WCAG 2.1 compliance.

I also code accessibility fixes, guide teams through accessibility, and write documentation on workflow and accessibility topics.

Additionally, my team and I work to optimize the process of how other teams work with accessibility. Our goal is to make working with our team as easy and streamlined as possible.

All-in-all, it’s a fun mix of work that I enjoy very much.

As I continue my journey in this field, I find myself remaining curious about web accessibility, user experiences, and the legal accessibility landscape.
