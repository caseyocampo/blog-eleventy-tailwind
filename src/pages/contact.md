Below I’ve included a short list of some reasons to get in touch. If there’s something else you’d like to chat about, feel free to send along a message.

Here are some reasons to contact me:

- Grammar/typo
- Accessibility issue
- Constructive feedback
- Questions and/or comments

Note: when I started this website I added a contact form on this page for these types of inquiries. Since then, I’ve gotten enough spam (even with the reCAPTCHA tool on) to steer me away from keeping a contact form on here.

So, I’m directing all queries to my LinkedIn account.

## How to Get in Touch

Find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseyocampo/" target="_blank">LinkedIn {% newtab %}</a>. You can connect and send me a message there. I’ll do my best to get back to you as soon as practical.
