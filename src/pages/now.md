This page was inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">Derek Sivers’ nownownow.com {% newtab %}</a>. I first learned about it from reading his books and blog. Then, I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.tempertemper.net/now" target="_blank">tempertemper.net 's "now" page {% newtab %}</a> which I took as a friendly reminder to make one myself!

**P.S.** I don't have social media (except [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseyocampo/) if you count that). I used to be on it all the time but it's just not my thing anymore. Cal Newport said it best in his Ted Talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7hkPZ-HTk" target="_blank">Quit social media {% newtab %}</a> and in his post <a href="https://calnewport.com/on-digital-minimalism/" target="_blank">On Digital Minimalism {% newtab %}</a>.
