## Here's a bit of what's going on in my life right now:

- Building out my budgeting app TallyPad
- Recovering from unknown respiratory issues!
- Using my pool on weekends to cool off from the Florida heat
- Taking my motorcycle (a 2025 Ninja 500) on Sunday morning rides (check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RideWithCasey" target="_blank">my YouTube channel for more rides and bike stuff! <span aria-label=", opens in a new tab">↗</span></a>)
- Swapping out the original seat post for a PNW dropper post on my Ozark Trail Ridge mountain bike

**P.S.** I don't have social media (except [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseyocampo/) if you count that). I used to be on it all the time but it's just not my thing anymore. Cal Newport said it best in his Ted Talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7hkPZ-HTk" target="_blank">Quit social media {% newtab %}</a> and in his post <a href="https://calnewport.com/on-digital-minimalism/" target="_blank">On Digital Minimalism {% newtab %}</a>.
