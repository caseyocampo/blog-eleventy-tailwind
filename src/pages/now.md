## What's the deal with this "now" page?

Well, I don't have social media (except [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseyocampo/) if you count that) - I used to be on it all the time but it's just not my thing anymore. Here are a few things that helped me shape my decision to leave: check out Cal Newport's post <a href="https://calnewport.com/on-digital-minimalism/" target="_blank">On Digital Minimalism {% newtab %}</a> or his Ted Talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7hkPZ-HTk" target="_blank">Quit social media {% newtab %}</a>).

That said, I do still enjoy reading about what people are up to and sharing what I'm up to! So, here's a bit of what's going on in my life _right now_:

- Recovering from a concussion, banged up elbow and knee thanks to my first rough mountain bike fall
- Got all of the bathrooms in our house renovated!
- Saw the new Alien Romulus movie with my partner
- Gaining way too much weight since being cooped up in the house recovering
- Tinkering around with the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/" target="_blank">Pokémon API {% newtab %}</a> and the JavaScript fetch API
- Researching and buying bike safety gear - I bought Leatt Impact Shorts, Leatt Airflex Body Armor, and IXS Carve Elbow Pads. I already bought a new IXS full face helmet and POC VPD knee pads!

_This page was inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">Derek Sivers’ nownownow.com {% newtab %}</a>. I first learned about it from reading his books and blog. Then, I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.tempertemper.net/now" target="_blank">tempertemper.net 's "now" page {% newtab %}</a> which I took as a friendly reminder to make one myself!_
