## What's the deal with this "now" page?

Well, I don't have social media. I got fed up with the ads, phoniness, and slot-machine-likeness of it all (see Cal Newport's post <a href="https://calnewport.com/on-digital-minimalism/" target="_blank">On Digital Minimalism {% newtab %}</a> or his Ted Talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7hkPZ-HTk" target="_blank">Quit social media {% newtab %}</a>).

Over the last 4 years, I've stepped away from using social media in favor of spending more time outside, being with friends and family, reading books, learning stuff, working on side projects, and sleeping! That said, I do still enjoy reading about what people are up to! So here's a bit of what's going on in my life _right now_:

- Taking up a new hobby, mountain biking, for the last few months
- Upgrading my 2023 Specialized Rockhopper Sport bike - so far I've added a dropper post, new stem and carbon stem spacers, handlebars, grips, and most recently, tires and a new fork
- Working on perfecting thin, crispy homemade pizza made with a high protein dough mixture of vital wheat gluten and King Arthur flour
- Getting more steps in with my new walking pad
- Watching _all_ of the Aliens movies with my partner Jeff
- Learning more about <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank">Eleventy {% newtab %}</a>

_This page was inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">Derek Siversâ€™ nownownow.com {% newtab %}</a>. I first learned about it from reading his books and blog. Then, I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.tempertemper.net/now" target="_blank">tempertemper.net 's "now" page {% newtab %}</a> which I took as a friendly reminder to make one myself!_
