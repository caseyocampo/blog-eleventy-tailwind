In August of 2021, I wrote an article on freeCodeCamp’s forum titled _How I Learned to Code and Got My First Developer Job, and How I’m Progressing Now_.

Quincy Larson (the creator of freeCodeCamp) saw that I tweeted about how I used freeCodeCamp to get my first developer job. He sent me a message and asked me about my background and what I did to learn how to code. Later on in the conversation, he asked me to write an article about it on freeCodeCamp’s forum.

With great respect, I humbly accepted.
